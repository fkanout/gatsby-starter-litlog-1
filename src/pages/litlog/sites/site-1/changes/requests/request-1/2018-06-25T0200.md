+## Specification
+
+In the root of the project and in *src/pages/litlog* there will be a *sites* folder that contains a site folder for each site. *root/sites* contains <litlog-link to="/files/">files</litlog-link> and *src/pages/litlog/sites* contains <litlog-link to="/requests/">requests</litlog-link>, <litlog-link to="/tasks/">tasks</litlog-link>, and <litlog-link to="/changes/">changes</litlog-link>. *slugs* are references to items in either location.
+
+<litlog-link to="/requests/">requests</litlog-link> will contain Requests. Requests will have a title, a date, a status (open/closed), and a body which represents the specification of the request. The slug of an individual request is *requests/request-number* where *number* is a one-up number. The body may start as blank but details can be filled in through an iterative process.
+
+<litlog-link to="/tasks/">tasks</litlog-link> will contain Tasks. Tasks will have a title, date, a status (not-started/in-progress/completed), a request field, and a body which represents the plan and/or execution of the task in ordered steps. The slug of an individual task is *tasks/task-number* where *number* is a one-up number. 
+
+<litlog-link to="/files/">files</litlog-link> will be a subfolder of <litlog-link to="/">litlog</litlog-link> and will contain Files. Files are empty files at this time. The slug of an individual file is `/files/relative-path` where `relative-path` is the relative path of the file to the project. Files represent files in the project which will be referred to in the documentation system. 
+
+<litlog-link to="/changes/">changes</litlog-link> will contain Changes. Changes will have a title (Create/Update), status (created/creating/updated/updating), and a body which includes details about the change. The gerund version of the verb (creating/updating) indicates work on that file is in process. The past tense version of the verb (created/updated) indicates work on that file is complete. The slug of an individual change is *changes/referent-slug/datetime* where *referent-slug* is the slug of the referent and *datetime* is an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) when the change was made without the colon between hours and minutes or minutes and seconds (i.e., "2018-06-08T0800"). Changes to changes are not recorded since this would be recursive.
